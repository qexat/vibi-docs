== Registers

* Number of registers: 16footnote:[8 of them are current registered.]
* Register size: 8 bytes (64 bits)

=== Register names

* ``ia``: instruction address^C^
* ``ra``: return address^C^
* ``res``: result of the operation^C^
* ``op<n>``: `n`-th operand (e.g. `op3`: third operand)^C^

5 registers are dedicated to be operands.
Syscalls that require more than 5 parameters should expect on the last operand register a pointer to a struct containing the rest of the arguments.

== Flash memory

Flash memory is basically like RAM but its access is not random.

* Sizefootnote:[It is configurable before starting the machine. It cannot be changed once it is running.]: 268'435'456 (2^28^) bytes
